# Tanks
The objective is to shoot as many targets as you can.

This was initially made during the Spring of 2017.

A simplified OpenGL library file was used to do this.
The library file was made by that Prof. Bedrich Benes of Purdue University.

## Controls:
  - The scene can be rotated around with the mouse.
  - WASD to move the tank
  - '1' to shoot
  - 'E' or 'e' to exit

Run [this exe](https://github.com/VarunRamakri7/Tanks/blob/master/Tanks_Ramakrishnan_V/Debug/Ramakrishnan_V_Tanks.exe) to play the game (shown in the images below). The menu is part of a different file in [this exe](https://github.com/VarunRamakri7/Tanks/blob/master/Tanks_Ramakrishnan_V/Debug/cgt215.exe)<br/>
The main difference between the two files is the colors and the menu.

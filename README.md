# Tanks
The objective is to shoot as many targets as you can.

This was initially made during the Spring of 2017.

A simplified OpenGL library file was used to do this.
The library file was made by that Prof. Bedrich Benes of Purdue University.

Controls:
  - The scene can be rotated around with the mouse.
  - WASD to move the tank
  - '1' to shoot
  - 'E' or 'e' to exit

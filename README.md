# Tanks
The objective is to shoot as many targets as you can.

A simplified OpenGL library file was used to do this.
The library file was made by that Prof. Bedrich Benes of Purdue University.

The game is made with a 90's PopArt style.

Controls:
  - The scene can be rotated around with the mouse.
  - WASD to move the tank
  - '1' to shoot
  - 'E' or 'e' to exit
